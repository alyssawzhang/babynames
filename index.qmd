# Introduction
Alyssa and Austin were the names my parents chose out of a baby name book for me and twin brother when we were born in 2002. These were fairly popular American baby names during the late nineties/early aughts, perhaps due to the prominence of celebrity Alyssa Milano and the release of the Austin Powers film trilogy. I always found it interesting that my parents unwittingly followed a trend, and want to discover other American baby name trends that have occurred over a variety of times and locations. This is a fascinating topic that relates to demography, linguistics, and sociology.

Some questions I'm interested in studying are:
1. Have gender neutral names become more/less common over time?
2. Which names have switched genders over time?
3.
